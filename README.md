# UFOs
## Oveview of the Project

The purpose of this project was to take a given data set about aliens and ufo spotting, and to turn it into a website where the user can easily filter through to find whath they are looking for. 

## Results

The best way to demonstrate how the website works is to perform a search. Opening up the index.html, we get to this page:

Scrolling down to the seach bars, one can see a table with the intended format that one can search for. To do a search, simply type in the bar. To start my first search, I will set the country to the United States, since that is where I live so it will be interesting to see what the results are.

Going futher, I will filter to my state, California, my home state:

There are quite a few results of ufo spottings in California. One name that I keep seeing ie El Cajon. So lets edit our search to investigate this further.

There seem to be big ufo spotting in El Cajon on New Years Day in 2010. That is very intersting! Was it just a trick of the lights or something else?

## Summary

While this website does a good job of filtering out the data that we want, it still has a lot that can be improved apon. One draw back of the website as it stands is that the input paramters are rather strict. The filter needs to be in a specific format otherwise it won't return anything. I would reccomend that a more user friendly filter be implemented. One that gives the user feedback when an incorrect input is taken, or one that can be more felixble with the inputs, for example taking 'usa' or 'united states' instead of just 'us'for country. Another thing I would reccomend is to try and find a more current database. The database that is being used is static, so there will never be any updates. Perhaps we could alter our app.js file to connect to a new data base with more up to date info.
